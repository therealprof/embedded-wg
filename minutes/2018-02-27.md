# Meeting agenda

- Issues nominated for Epoch 2018 milestoning
  - Integration with C codebases - https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/48 +1
  - Consistent development experience - https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/44

- Topics to discuss during Rust All Hands?

- Call for Action URL+text for the 2018 roadmap blog post
  - cf. https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/issues/229
  - use the rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg README?
    - what else can we add?

- $YOUR_AGENDA_ITEM

- Docker Containers
   - Context: I have a HiFive1 board, but haven't managed to build the toolchain successfully on OSX
      - Not because it's bad, but because it takes a long time to build and I end up task-switching to something else and never get around to researching a fix.
   - Can we build / collect / document Docker containers for targets that require a custom Rust build?
      - https://github.com/qmx/docker-avr-rust
      - RISCV, MSP430, any others?
      - Ideally would be implemented in similar styles and with same base containers to make them easier to maintain.
      - Process for building / uploading recent builds?
   - Just rediscovered [japaric/cross](https://github.com/japaric/cross) which makes it easy to use rust Docker containers for cross-compilation.
      - Currently supports many targets, but seems to depend on locally installed rust - is this true?
      - If so, can it be extended to support using fully self-contained containers as described above?
I have an open PR for cross to move all of the rust internals to Docker Volumes, removing the dependency on the host env:
    https://github.com/japaric/cross/pull/131 - it probably needs some more work, it was a PoC from a few months ago.

- Close https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/25 ? +1
  - on that note we don't have built-in targets for Cortex-R either

# Rust All Hands

- Ship LLVM binutils with the Rust toolchain - https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/50
- Test embedded targets as part of rust-lang/rust CI - https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/52
- Xargo in Cargo
- Cargo project templates
- Panic handler binary size bloat - https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/41
- Unblock AVR backend from landing by temporarily `cfg(not(target_arch = "avr"))`-ing away all i128 code from core
- see if we can wrangle someone with experience on how firefox integrates rust into a C++ build ecosystem
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47074 - Multiple codegen units breaks linking: "undefined reference to rust_begin_unwind"

# Minutes

- put docs under the -wg repo for now. Until we have space on the rust-lang website
- embedonomicon
- We'd need to make sure the book talks in Rust terms, not necessarily svd2rust or cortex-m-rt terms
- boundary: shared ELF tooling
- consensus: elf tooling, embedded-hal
- "So far my guideline has been, if it shares a user manual (or whatever the manufacturer calls their document), it can share a crate." -- on HAL for device families
- add jcsoo text to the README? - https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/blob/master/minutes/2018-02-20.md#jcsoo

The Rust Embedded Stack: Rust, Arch, Chip/SoC, Board, Application

WG one-liners:
  - JP: From a blinking an LED to building a WiFi Router, if you want to build any scale of embedded system, the $WG is here to help.
  - James: Embedded development doesn't have to be painful! Join us at $WG to make 2018 the year of Rust on Embedded!
  - Help make Rust the best language and ecosystem for embedded programming. See https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg.
  - Quality, productivity, accessibility: Rust can change the embedded industry for the better. Let's get this process started in 2018! Join us at $LINK
  - Friends don't let friends be stuck with C. Help us make 2018 the year of embedded Rust! Join us at $LINK
  - Higher quality, better productivity, less pain, more fun. Let's work together to raise the bar for embedded development! Join us at $LINK
